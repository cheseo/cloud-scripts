# About
These are some of the scripts that i created to learn cloud computing.
Most of these automate very simple regular tasks.

## new-user username [public-key [useradd-options]]
This scripts creates a new user named username, and if a public key is given, adds that to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

This script shows a password of the newly created user.

## firewall-activate
This script creates default firewall rules by using ufw.
