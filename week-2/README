# network-diagnose
This script has a set of sub-commands to diagnose network. They are:

dns:
	Shows the dns records of domain name. You can chose the type of record to query.
latency:
	Uses the ICMP echo requests to find latency to a server.
http:
	Finds the time taken by a server to open a http connection. The port can be changed.
scan:
	Scans the given list of ports using nmap
